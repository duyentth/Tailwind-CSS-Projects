                        I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I

                        have heard some people who had an amazing experience
                        here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it
                        incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next
                        12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
                        life. Since completing the course, I've successfully
                        switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
